1. Create a folder in your desktop named "cv2"
2. Then go to your browser and download "vscode" our IDE
3. Then install vscode normally
4. Then go to python.org and download the latest version of python for Windows
5. Then go to google and type  "unofficial python packages for windows" then follow the first link.
6. Download 3 major packages: Numpy, OpenCV and Pandas- version cp38 and 32BIT for all! It doesn't matter if you're on 64bit. Just install 32BIT!

Or follow these to trace them

a. numpy‑1.18.2+mkl‑cp38‑cp38‑win32.whl
b. opencv_python‑4.2.0‑cp38‑cp38‑win32.whl
c. pandas‑1.0.3‑cp38‑cp38‑win32.whl

AT THIS POINT, JUMP TO STEP 7. YOU CAN COME BACK HERE LATER TO INSTALL GIT AND GITHUB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6b. Go to your browser again and type GITHUB and go to the website.
6c. Create an account and verify your email.
6d. Then go to your fresh browser again and type GIT. Then follow that site "git-scm.com"
6e. Click that link in a laptop screen saying "Download 2.26.0 for windows" to download.
6f. Then go to your GITHUB online and create a Repository. A repository is like your online Folder. Git will be used to syncronize and store our codes. It's a version control tool to track changes in the cause of our codes.

Major techniques in GIT
"git status"
"git add ."
git commit -m"New commit"
git push -u origin master

FOLLOW THE VIDEO WEBINAR
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Open your Command Line Interface CMD through ADMIN Priviledge Mode Only, otherwise, it will not work
Steps:
a. Click on the Windows key + R and a dialog box will pop up
b. Right on the box, type "cmd" and press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER 
c. This will launch you into the Command Line in Admin mode.

7. Then upgrade your installer named "PIP" using "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"

8. Then use "cd" to change directory and "ls or dir" to list directories whenever to navigate through

9. Navigate to downloads and type "dir" to list out directories.

10. Highlight and copy one at a time to install using "pip install "numpy‑1.18.2+mkl‑cp38‑cp38‑win32.whl" " 

11. Do not include the quotation marks housing the pip in step 10.

12. Do step 10 for all the other packages b and c in step 6.

13. Test installation by going to your cmd again and typing "python"

14. Then type "import numpy", and next line "import cv2"

Then you are set.

15. Use "exit()" to exit 

Go to your VSCODE IDE

But first...

16. Go to your cmd again, and navigate to your folder or create one like this: type them as you see them below
a. cd Desktop
b. mkdir cv2
c. cd cv2
d. touch project1.py
e. code .

In step e of 16, it is 'code' first then space '.' a fullstop to launch into VSCODE through your workfolder

17. Then follow the tutorial steps for the Coding Proper. We will first make a face detector along some up coming improvements and projects ahead. Ensure youre webcam works fine.
